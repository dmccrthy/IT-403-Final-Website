        The 80's would end up being both a very good, as well as a very bad decade for video games. Near
        the start of the decade in 1983, the home video game industry saw a major crash as consumers lost
        interest in buying video game consoles.

        In many ways this disinterest is justified; anyone who's had the misfortune of playing one of these 
        old Atari games could tell you that. Although the 1983 crash left the US games market in the trenches, 
        Japan continued to see interest in home consoles with companies like Sega and Nintendo releasing during 
        this period.
