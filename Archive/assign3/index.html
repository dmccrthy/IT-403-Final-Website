      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Trees are a type of <em>plant</em> known for there large number of <strong>branches</strong> 
        and <strong>leaves</strong>. Contrary to popular belief trees exist (I think).

      <h2>Why are Trees?</h2>
      <p>
        Trees serve an important role in our world as they convert <em>harmful</em> carbon dioxide into oxygen. 
        Trees also provide other resources like wood, and paper, which is cool.
