        The 2010’s would be a pretty light decade for home consoles with only one generation of releases. Nintendo 
        would start off this generation in 2012 with the followup to the Wii with the Wii U. The Wii U had a rough 
        release primarily due to its similarities to the original Wii. Not long after this in 2013 both Microsoft 
        \and Sony would release their consoles; these being the Xbox One, and PS4 respectively. Besides the new stuff 
        being tried by Nintendo this generation would stand as more of the same from the previous decade.

        Given the commercial failure of the Wii U, Nintendo would come back with another console during this generation 
        culminating in the release of the Nintendo Switch. Although arguably NOT a home console, the Switch is still treated 
        like one by Nintendo so I’m counting it. Unlike the earlier Wii U, the Switch would turn out to be a much larger success. 
        Though it took inspiration from the Wii, it was still able to create its own unique identity, which isn’t something 
        the Wii U had much success with.
