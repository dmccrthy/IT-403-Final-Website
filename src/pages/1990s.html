        The 1990's would mark a big turning point when it comes to video game technologies. During this decade 
        we would see major technological advancements with 3D graphics becoming the norm, as well as increased 
        competition in the console market with new competitors like Sony entering the industry.

        Before we can talk about 3D games, we first have to look at the burgeoning console war between Sega and 
        Nintendo. With how well Sega was doing with the 16-bit Genesis, Nintendo was going to need to release a 
        new 16-bit console if they wanted to compete. This all came together with the release of the Super Nintendo 
        Entertainment System (SNES) in 1991, which served as a direct response to the Sega Genesis. Although Sega 
        had a headstart in this new generation of consoles, Nintendo would manage to catch up in terms of sales, and 
        eventually surpass the earlier success of the Genesis.

        While this console war was going on, technology continued getting better, and soon 32 and 64 bit processors 
        became economical for console manufacturers. It would be along with these improved processors that companies 
        would begin moving to CD storage over the cartridges that had been used up to this point. The first console to 
        actually take advantage of this tech would come with the release of the Sega Saturn in 1996, though this release 
        would end up being a bit of a mess as Sega pushed out the console 5 months ahead of schedule to get ahead of the 
        competition. For consumers, the first “real” introduction to 3D video games would come with Sony's debut home console, 
        the PlayStation. I say this as outside of the PlayStation just selling way more systems, it also had a much bigger 
        library of games that utilized the 3D technology.

      <p>
        Similar to their release of the SNES, Nintendo entered into this generation of consoles  way behind the rest of their 
        competition. To make things even weirder Nintendo decided upon a cartridge based system for there new 64 bit console, 
        even though it increased the manufacturing cost of there games, and limited the max size of games on the system. Despite 
        these drawbacks the Nintendo 64 would make a release in 1996, and would still manage to outsell the Saturn released a 
        year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the lackluster sales of the Sega Saturn, and their withdrawal from the console market soon after in 1999 
        after the release of the Dreamcast, it's safe to say at this point the console war was truly at its end. This isn’t 
        to say there was no longer any competition in the console market, more so that there was increasingly heavy competition 
        from new competitors entering into the industry.
