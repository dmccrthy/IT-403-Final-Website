        In the present, we’ve seen the release of the Xbox “Series” consoles, as well as the PS5. For the 
        most part these consoles serve as a continuation of their earlier counterparts, but for Microsoft's 
        part, they would end up doing something weird here releasing two different consoles at once(these being the Series X and S). 
        The main distinction between the two being the Series X has support for physical DVD’s, while the Series S is 
        digital only. While purchasing digital games isn’t new, this decision by Microsoft represents a big shift that's 
        likely to come to home consoles in future generations. Considering how physical game sales have been declining for 
        well over a decade, it . Personally, I don’t really agree with this move as in the long term it's only going to hurt 
        consumers. This will be especially true in some years from now when Microsoft decides they don’t want to support these 
        older consoles, and as a result leaving these digital only systems as glorified paper weights.

        In terms of advancing technology, one topic that has been coming up over the past few years, has been this 
        idea of a “Metaverse” with a focus on VR and AR technologies. VR gaming isn’t exactly new, with even Sony 
        releasing a VR headset for the earlier PS4, but it seems likely with the increased investment into these areas 
        that we’ll eventually see a bigger focus on VR gaming in the console market.
