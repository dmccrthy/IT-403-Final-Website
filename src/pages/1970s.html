        The 70's would end up being a pretty important time for video games as a medium. During this decade, 
        both home consoles, and arcade games would be introduced to consumers, and develop into a substantial industry.

        The first home console release came in 1972 with the Magnavox Odyssey, which itself was based on a 
        device designed by Ralph Baer from 1967. The Odyssey was far from the type of console you'd see today, 
        with its simple black and white graphics and limited number of games. Although the Odyssey was a big 
        step in the history of video games, that doesn’t necessarily mean the console was all that successful. 
        Due to poor sales(~300k during its lifetime) the Odyssey would end up being discontinued in 1975.

        Though Magnavox’s first console wasn’t too successful, this wouldn’t stop other companies from 
        getting into the new home console market. Only 2 years after the discontinuation of the Odyssey 
        in 1975, Atari would come out with their Atari VCS (later renamed to Atari 2600). Up to this point 
        Atari had been playing a big role in the development of arcade cabinets, so logically getting into 
        home consoles would be the obvious next step. Early in the 2600’s release, sales would remain similar 
        to the earlier Magnavox Odyssey, but as the 70’s came to a close 2600’s sales would quickly pick up as 
        Atari made an effort to release new games like Space Invaders.
