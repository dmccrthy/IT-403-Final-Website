        The turn of the millennium would mark an interesting time in the home console market, as most companies 
        wouldn’t release their new consoles until nearly 2 years in the decade. This of course wasn’t including Sega, 
        who decided to release their next (and last) console in 1999 to try and get ahead of the competition. 
        Although the Sega Dreamcast is generally considered apart of this console generation, in some ways it can 
        be difficult to justify that, especially when you consider that Sega discontinued the device before most 
        other consoles during this time even released (the sole exception to this was Sony who released their next 
        console about 6 months before the Dreamcast was canned). This event is pretty important as this would mark 
        Sega’s last home console release, leaving Sony and Nintendo the only established names still in the market.

        Speaking of Sony and Nintendo their next console releases would come out during this time. The first of the two 
        to release was Sony with their PlayStation 2 (PS2) which saw massive success during its release, in part due to 
        its backwards compatibility with the PS1. To this date, the PS2 still stands as the best selling home console of 
        all time, with few consoles since then even coming close. Not long after this Nintendo would release the Gamecube 
        which proved to be less successful then the record setting PS2. Outside of these two, this period would see the 
        most recent console manufacturer (at least that people actually care about) enter the market with Microsoft and 
        their first Xbox console.

        Only a few years after these releases, the 3 big console companies would return for another generation of releases. 
        This time around Microsoft would be the first to release with the Xbox 360, followed by the PS3 and Nintendo Wii 
        about a year later. The new “trend” for this generation, if you can even call it that, would end up being online 
        video games. Online gaming wasn’t invented with these console releases, as online games particularly on PC had been 
        around since the start of the decade, but this would be the first time this medium was made readily available on a 
        standalone console.

        Outside of that, it's impossible to ignore what Nintendo was doing during this time. While Sony and Microsoft were 
        neck and neck with their consoles, Nintendo would end up winning this generation (at least in terms of sales) when 
        it came to their Wii console. The Wii’s success can be attributed to a lot of things, but a big part of it was that 
        it got people who wouldn’t typically buy game consoles, to buy a gaming console.
