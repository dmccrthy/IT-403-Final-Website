        The 80's would end up being both a very good, and a very bad decade for home game consoles. Near the start 
        of the decade in 1983, coming off the rapid success of the Atari 2600 the American video game market would 
        see a major crash as consumers lost interest in buying video games.

        In many ways this disinterest is pretty justified; anyone who's had the misfortune of playing some of these 
        older Atari games could tell you that. A big reason for this decline in video games came as a result of high 
        prices, and declining quality in games. The big issue here was that game developers were seeing the massive 
        success of the 2600, and looking to cash in on its popularity many decided to release lackluster games with 
        little to no effort put into them. It's also interesting to consider how expensive games, and game consoles 
        were at this time, especially compared to today. For example, the Atari 2600 when adjusted for inflation would 
        set you back well over $700 dollars in today's money, nearly double what new consoles are selling for now.

        Although the 1983 crash left the US market in disrepair, Japan continued to see interest in home consoles with 
        companies like Sega and Nintendo releasing consoles during this period. A few years after the 1983 video game 
        crash Nintendo, seeing an opening in the market, would begin work to localize their existing Famicom system for 
        a US release. This would all culminate in 1985 with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System(NES), arguably 
        the most iconic game systems ever released. With Nintendo putting a big emphasis on quality with the game catalog 
        for the NES, they were able to avoid some of the pitfalls that Atari faced earlier in the decade. With how successful 
        the NES was it's no surprise that Nintendo’s main Japanese competitor Sega would want to get into the US market. For 
        their first US release, Sega would come out with the Sega Genesis which would mark a turning point in console hardware 
        as it incorporated a 16-bit processor, compared to the 8-bit ones used in older consoles. It's because of this improved 
        hardware as well as their new mascot Sonic the Hedgehog that Sega was able to take over a significant stake in the US 
        video game market as the 80’s came to a close.
